# Transfer-Learning-Image-classification
This project uses transfer learning on a raw dataset collected on a holiday in Africa, where collector went on a safari to observe wild animals in their natural habitat. During this trip he captured 100 photos each of buffalo, elephants, rhinos and zebras. Now they asked me to categorise them.

To avoid manually labelling each of the 400 photos, I decide that it would be more fun to build an image classification neural network to solve the problem. This way, I am able to just label 10 images of each animal and let a classifier sort out the rest.
